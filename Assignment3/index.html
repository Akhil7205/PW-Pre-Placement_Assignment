    Ans:
    With media queries, you can create CSS rules that adapt the layout, positioning, font sizes, or any
    other aspect of your webpage to fit different screen sizes and devices. This allows for a better user
    experience across a wide range of devices, from large desktop screens to small mobile devices.
    Media queries are a fundamental tool in responsive web design, enabling you to create flexible and

    Q.2 How do you define a media query in CSS?
    Ans:
    To define a media query in CSS, you use the @media rule followed by a media type and a condition or set of
    conditions that determine when the styles within the media query should be applied
    we write in form of :

    @media media-type and (condition){
        css rule to apply when condition meet
    }

    Let's break down the different parts of a media query:

    @media: This keyword signifies the start of a media query rule.

    media-type: It represents the type of media being targeted. Some common media types are all 
    (default), screen, print, speech, projection, etc. The screen media type is commonly used for targeting screens of devices.

    condition: This is a condition or set of conditions that determine when the styles within the media query should be applied.
    It can be based on various factors such as the width or height of the viewport, orientation, resolution, and more. 
    You use comparison operators such as min-width, max-width, orientation, etc., to define the conditions.

    Q.3 Explain the concept of Breakpoints in Responsive Web Design and How They are used in Media Queries.
    Ans:
    responsive web design, breakpoints are specific points or thresholds in the viewport width where the layout of 
    a web page changes to accommodate different screen sizes and devices. They determine when certain CSS rules or 
    styles should be applied or modified to provide an optimal user experience.

    Breakpoints are commonly used in conjunction with media queries to create responsive designs. Media queries allow 
    you to apply different styles or rules based on specific conditions, such as the viewport width. By defining
     breakpoints within media queries, you can adapt the layout and styles of your web page to different screen sizes.

    comnly used breakpoints for various devices are :
    for moblie screen it is max-480px
    for tablet screen it is min-481px max-786px
    for desktop screen it is min-787px 
    
    Mobile breakpoint 
    @media (max-width: 480px) {
      }
      
     Tablet breakpoint 
      @media (min-width: 481px) and (max-width: 768px) {
      }
      
       Desktop breakpoint 
      @media (min-width: 769px) {
        
      }
